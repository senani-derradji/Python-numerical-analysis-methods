# Python Numerical Analysis Methods

This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical analysis methods. These methods are widely used for solving mathematical problems, such as finding roots, solving equations, and approximating functions. The project includes implementations of methods like the Dichotomy method, Newton's method, and Successive Approximations.

## Repository Structure

```plaintext
Python-numerical-analysis-methods/
├── Dichotomy.py                      # Implements the Dichotomy method for root finding
├── Newton.py                         # Implements Newton's method for finding roots of equations

```

## Description of Files

- **Dichotomy.py**: This script implements the Dichotomy method, which is used for finding the root of a continuous function. It works by narrowing down the interval where the root lies until the root is found with sufficient accuracy.

- **Newton.py**: This script contains the implementation of Newton's method, a powerful iterative method used for finding successively better approximations of the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function.

- **Successive_Approximations.py**: This file implements the Successive Approximations method, which is another technique for finding the root of an equation through an iterative process.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senani-derradji/Python-numerical-analysis-methods.git
   ```

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   Each script is independent and can be run individually. To use them:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.
   - Execute any script by running:
     ```bash
     python <script_name>.py
     ```

3. **Customize Input**:
   You can modify the input values or equations within the script files to suit your problem and run the numerical methods accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies are required for these methods; however, you can extend these methods by using libraries such as NumPy for more advanced operations.
